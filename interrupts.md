# Interrupts
1. Interrupt Occurs
2. CPU acknowledges the interrupt
3. Interrupt controller determins which interrupt to deliver (if multiple pending)
4. Interrupt handler runs
5. Signals interrupt controller that interrupt is handled
6. Returns to context stored before handling interrupt and resumes task

## Why Interrupts?
Interrupts are essential for real time responsiveness, as they allow CPUs to cofus on
useful work instead of polling.

## Linux top half / bottom half model
In the linux kernel interrupts run in interrupt context aka. top half (no blocking
allowed), which must finish quickly. It is used to acknowledge the interrupt and queue
deferred work to be executed in bottom half.

The bottom half refers to the deferred work executed later in process context where
blocking is allowed.

## Hardware Interrupts
Hardware interrupts are generated by external devices like keyboards, network cards etc.
to signal hardware events that require CPU attention. Examples would be key presses on
the keyboard or packets received over the network by the network card.

## Software Interrupts
Software interrupts are generated by software to request kernel services.

## Exceptions and Traps
Special interrupts caused by errors or special conditions in CPU execution. Examples are
'divide by zero' or 'page fault'.
